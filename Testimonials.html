    <p class= "testtext"> "The Collective Solution team was incredibly collaborative, innovative and efficient. 
        They streamlined our workflows, aggregated and organized our data and brought us into the twenty-first century. 
        As a result, we are now able to better determine where to focus our efforts and we have optimized our systems and operations - without affecting our bottom line.
        They are proficient in a wide range of software and worked with us to create custom solutions that fit with our capacity and budget." </p>
    <p class="personsname">-Alison Palmer, Executive Director, Ontario Land Trust Alliance</p>  
          
    <p class= "testtext"> "We hired The Collective Solution to perform a highly detailed spatial analysis to assess potential risks associated with climate change. 
        They built a tailor-made model to identify patterns and make predictions so that we could determine how best to allocate our resources and protect our assets. 
        They employed cutting-edge software and geoprocessing techniques and automated workflows that we can re-use going forward, reducing our analysis time significantly and giving us more time to spend on the ground."</p>
    <p class="personsname">-Oscar Peterson, Research and Analysis Vice President, Canadian Institute for Climate Choices</p>
    
    <p class= "testtext"> "We were absolutely thrilled with the custom maps The Collective Solution created for our organization. 
        They took the time to really understand our perspective, our values and how we operate. 
        The maps were highly effective at communicating our intended message to stakeholders and helped us to successfully obtain funding for our projects. 
        Not only were they works of art; they incorporated relevant and current scientific data in an easily digestible manner that evoked clarity, precision and thoughtful execution."</p>
