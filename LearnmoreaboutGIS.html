 <!-- some adapted from ESRI https://www.esri.com/en-us/what-is-gis/overview-->
        <p>A <a href=https://www.esri.com/en%2Dus/what%2Dis%2Dgis/history%2Dof%2Dgis class="links">GIS</a> (Geographic Information System) is a tool that allows us to explore the world virtually. 
          GIS can help you to identify problems, monitor changes, manage and respond to events, 
          perform forecasting, set priorities and understand trends that affect your organization.
          As GIS professionals, we are trained to help you put your data to work for you- not the 
          other way around. We provide an array of services including but not limited to Remote Sensing, 
          Cartography, Spatial Analysis, Database Management, and Web and Mobile Applications. 
          Our clients are as diverse as the planet itself: educational and healthcare institutions, 
          insurance and manufacturing companies, real estate, natural resource managers, transportation services and beyond! 
          Continue reading to discover how we can harness the power of GIS to create customized solutions to illuminate issues 
          driven by geography and help you gain actionable intelligence for a better, brighter future.</p>
          
          <h2>Remote Sensing</h2> <!-- Headings creating for each service category -->
          <!-- Content ideology from Remote Sensing Course Outline (Frank Kenny) -->
         <p> 
          We provide reliable interpretation and measurement of physical, biological, and cultural features from satellite and aerial imagery.
           We work with raster data to perform geometric correction, atmospheric correction, filtering and image classification techniques. 
           We can process and interpret multispectral, thermal, Radar and LiDAR data and employ leading feature classification techniques using various algorithms to enhance decision-making and reveal intricate patterns.
            We use <a href=https://catalyst.earth/products class="links">CATALYST</a> software, a suite of products created by the ground-breaking Canadian software development company PCI Geomatics. </p>
          
            <h2>Cartography </h2>
            <!-- Content ideology from Geovisualization Outline (Marikka Williams) -->
           <p> 
            The discipline of <a href=https://www.directionsmag.com/article/10123 class="links">cartography</a> has long been about the art and science of communicating geospatial information through the incorporation of graphical symbology. 
            Over the past two decades, geographic visualization, or geovisualization, has emerged to include not only the cartographic domain but also the understanding of the human cognition of information visualization and the inclusion of technology. 
            As within numerous other scientific fields, the use of sophisticated interactive computer technologies has enabled geographers to render greater supporting geospatial data analysis using interactive visualization. 
            Collectively these factors are allowing for more advanced human-map interaction in revealing unknowns through visual communication. 
            We are well-versed in a wide range of software used to create cartographic output include: <a href=https://qgis.org/en/site class="links">QGIS</a>, <a href=https://www.avenza.com/mapublisher class="links">Avenza MAPublisher</a> and  <a href=https://www.esri.com/en%2Dus/home class="links">ESRI</a> products such as <a href=https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/main/map/what%2Dis%2Darcmap%2D.htm class="links">ArcMap</a>, <a href=https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro%2Dapp/latest/get%2Dstarted/get%2Dstarted.htm class="links">ArcGIS Pro</a> and <a href=https://www.esri.com/en%2Dus/arcgis/products/arcgis%2Donline/overview class="links">ArcGIS Online</a>. </p>
             
            <h2>Spatial Analysis</h2>
            <!--Content ideology from Spatial Analysis Outline (Marikka Williams) and ESRI https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/analysis/introduction/spatial-analysis-in-arcgis-pro.htm -->
          <p>
            Spatial analysis allows us to solve complex location-oriented problems. 
            It goes beyond mere mapping to reveal the characteristics of places and the relationships between them. 
            Spatial analysis can lend new perspectives to your decision-making. We use the five main technical components of a GIS, namely, input, storage, pre-processing, analysis and output using both the raster and vector spatial data models. 
            We use a wide variety of applications to display spatial distribution and trends, and perform geostatistical analysis, <a href=https://www.omnisci.com/technical%2Dglossary/geocoding class="links">geocoding</a> and networking, geodatabase topologies and advanced spatial analysis to help you better understand where and what is occurring in your organization.</p>

            <h2>Database Management</h2>
            <!--Content ideology from GIS Database Principles Course Outline (Shawn Morgan)-->
          <p>  
            We design, implement and manage databases using a variety of desktop, mobile and enterprise software. 
            We employ Structured Query Language (<a href=http://www.sqlcourse.com/intro.html class="links">SQL</a>) to build databases and manipulate data in preparation for future work in data processing, GIS analysis, and cartographic presentation. 
            We will standardize, formalize and streamline your data, making it easier and more efficient to manage.
            We can build more advanced relational databases and enterprise geodatabases that are customized for your organization. 
            We can also perform Extract, Transform, Load (<a href=https://www.talend.com/resources/what%2Dis%2Detl class="links">ETL</a>) workflows to translate data between different formats. </p>
          
            <h2>Web and Mobile Applications</h2>
            <!--content ideology from Web Design and Programming and Customization of GIS Applications Course Outlines (Shawn Morgan)-->
          <p>  
          The internet has changed the way we use maps. 
          We can build dynamic web pages and customized web GIS applications to meet your needs - whether you need <a href=https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/maps%2Dstatic/overview class="links">static</a> or <a href=https://www.netbraintech.com/blog/5%2Dcharacteristics%2Ddefine%2Ddynamic%2Dmap class="links">interactive</a> mapping. 
          We only employ the latest technical internet standards and techniques, including content markup, layout, colour, interactivity, all with a consideration for accessibility and usability. 
          We will work with you to develop customized GIS applications to meet specific user needs that link to other programs or develop standalone programs that integrate GIS capabilities. 
          If you can dream it, we can achieve it! </p>
