<h2> Population Density of Trenton, Ontario </h2>
<p> This map shows an example of a population density map created for the area of Trenton, Ontario. Trenton is an area located northeast of the City of Toronto. 
    It is part of the municipality of Quinte West and has a population of approximately 22,000. Within this work, the population density is shown with a purple colour ramp.
    The more densely populated regions have a darker purple assigned to them. As population decreases, the colour lightens. </p>

<h2> Topographic Generalized Map of Okanagan, British Columbia </h2>
<p> This map is a topographic map of Okanagan, British Columbia. In this work, the built-up areas, contours, forested areas and water systems are shown to depict 
    a generalized map. This work follows a traditional colour scheme in order to show elements within the map. Green will typically represent the forested areas, brown shows the contours,
    the lighter pink shows the built-up areas, and blue represents the water bodies. A good generalization of what the area contains can therefore be seen within the map frame. </p>

<h2> Heat Map of Pedestrian Collision Rates in Toronto, Ontario </h2>
<p> This map shows a heat map that was created to analyze the number of pedestrians involved in car crashes near school areas in the years 2011-2018 for Toronto, Ontario. The 
    areas shown in red and yellow signify areas with high collision rates. After further analysis, it was determined that as more speed signs were added near school areas, the number of collisions
    was reduced significantly. </p>

<h2> False Colour Composite (NDVI) of Lindsay, Ontario</h2>
<p> This map is a false colour composite that was created to analyze the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in further depth for an area near Lindsay, Ontario. The areas that have a 
    darker red colour shown in the map have higher rates of vegetation (higher reflectance) whereas the areas with lighter red colours have more sparse vegetation patterns (less reflectance).  </p>
