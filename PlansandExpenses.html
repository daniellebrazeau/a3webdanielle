<!--The first plan is a basic map creation estimated cost around $999.99-->

    <div class="mapbasicplan">
      <h3 class="plansheading"> Basic Map Creation / Analysis </h3>
      <p class="planstext"> This plan consists of the basic map-making creation. Maps are created based on the data you provide for us. 
                            These can be thematic, topographic, political or physical maps. The symbology, text and design of the 
                            maps can be fully specified to accommodate your business or personal needs. For this plan, we undertake 
                            the following processes:</p>
    
      <p class="planstext"> Map Creation <br>
                            Personalized Symbology <br>
                            Labels <br>

<!--The second plan consists of The Data acquisition and Database creation portion which is the cheapest plan-->

  <div class="columnPlans">
    <div class="dataplan">
      <h3 class="plansheading"> Data Acquisition and Database Creation </h3>
        <p class="planstext"> This plan consists of acquiring data based on the client specifications and the creation of a custom database.
                              For this process, our team will use ESRI's Survey123 to organize the data specified by the client. This data will then be imported 
                              in a Microsoft Access database and an ETL process will be performed to load all required data into one database.
                              For this plan, we undertake the following processes:</p>
        
        <p class="planstext"> Collection of Data <br>
                              Creation of Database <br>
                              Database ETL Process <br>

<!--The third plan consists of Map Creation along with Data collection and Database creation. This is the most expensive plan as it combines 2 plans at a reduced rate.-->

  <div class="columnPlans">
    <div class="mapplan">
      <h3 class="plansheading"> Map Creation / Analysis and Database Creation </h3>
        <p class="planstext"> This plan consists of the basic map-making creation along with database creation. A database will be created based
                              on the data you give us. When all data has been compiled through an ETL process, maps will be created to best represent the trends
                              and patterns you are seeking. For this plan, we undertake the following processes:</p>
    
        <p class="planstext"> Collection of Data <br>
                              Creation of Database <br>

<!--The final plan consists of a stream of work which is completely separate form the others (Remote sensing). This price is an average price and can carry as services are requested-->

  <div class="columnPlans">
    <div class="remoteplan">
      <h3 class="plansheading"> Remote Sensing Imagery </h3>
        <p class="planstext"> This plan consists of acquiring satellite imagery from various satellites. This data consistently remains updated 
                              due to the functionality of LANDSAT satellites. Different processes can be examined within the imagery and many 
                              corresponding factors within the images can be adjusted to best fit your needs.
                              For this plan, we undertake the following processes:</p>
    
        <p class="planstext"> Acquire Satellite Imagery <br>
